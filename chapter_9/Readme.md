Trying to remove the Dir will result in rmdir: chapter_9: Directory not empty
in other words, something is their, I can't do a soft remove on the Dir file structure.

when touching a previous file it updated the time that the file was last used.

#Can you touch blah.txt?
touch blah.txt
#Let's create foo.txt.
echo 'something' > foo.txt
or touch foo.txt
