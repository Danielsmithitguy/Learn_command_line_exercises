you would add the file dir at the end of `/Users/danielsmith/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.4/bin:/Users/danielsmith/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.4@global/bin:/Users/danielsmith/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.4/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Users/danielsmith/.rvm/bin`
However I don't know where 'your computer' dir would be located.
