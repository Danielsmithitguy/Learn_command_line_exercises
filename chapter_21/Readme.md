>###What is your shell set to?

`SHELL=/bin/bash`

>###What directory are you in (don't use pwd this time)?

`PWD=/Users/danielsmith/workspace/davinci_coders_t1_2016/homework/Learn_command_line_exercises`

>###What is your home directory set to?

Not sure what my home dir would be, nor is there anything that is explicit on
what the home dir would be under `env`

>###Can you set your environment to have DEBUG set to true?

Are you asking me to change the debug env to true or to make one set to true?
to make one would be `export DEBUG='True'` and if env had one called $DEBUG then 
`echo $DEBUG` should print it out, however it prints nothing.

>###change your PATH for your computer.

you would add the file dir at the end of `/Users/danielsmith/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.4/bin:/Users/danielsmith/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.4@global/bin:/Users/danielsmith/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.4/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Users/danielsmith/.rvm/bin`
However I don't know where 'your computer' dir would be located.
